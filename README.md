# Lab-tool-organizing

# About 
In this repo I'm organizing the files used for the Gridfinity-Skadis tool and inventory. 

#Todo
- Print out tests to see if this fits my needs
- Organize tools based on what assortment cases I need
- Analyze inventory of PLA plastics available, and buy more if needed
- Setup a throughput file system so I can slice files and print the ones next in line
